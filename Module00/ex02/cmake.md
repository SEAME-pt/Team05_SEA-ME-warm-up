# Differences between CMake and Make

| **Feature**                   | **CMake**                              | **Make**                              |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                    | Generates build configuration files (such as Makefiles or IDE project files). | Executes the build process as described in the Makefile. |
| **Portability**                | Generates portable build files for multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS). | Platform-dependent: the Makefile needs to be rewritten or modified for different platforms. |
| **Ease of Use**                | Easier for large projects, abstracts the build process. | Simple and direct, but requires more manual control, especially for large projects. |
| **Dependency Management**      | Supports easy dependency management with commands like `find_package`. | Dependencies need to be manually managed in the Makefile. |
| **Scalability**                | Better suited for large, complex projects with multiple directories and dependencies. | Works well for small projects but can become hard to manage in large projects. |
| **Flexibility**                | Abstract and automated, but allows for customization. | Full flexibility, but requires careful manual control. |
| **IDE Integration**            | Generates projects for popular IDEs like Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse, etc. | No direct IDE integration, though some IDEs can use Makefiles. |
| **Build System Management**    | Generates Makefiles but can also generate files for other build systems, like Ninja. | Only works with Make and tools compatible with Makefiles. |
